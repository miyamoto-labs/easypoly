# Synthdata Predictive Intelligence Hackathon

## Project: EasyPoly

**Tagline:** Democratizing Polymarket Alpha via Synthdata Intelligence

**Team:** Erik Austheim + Miyamoto (AI Co-Founder)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/miyamoto-labs/easypoly

---

## 🎯 What We Built

EasyPoly is an AI-powered Polymarket analytics platform that uses **Synthdata's probabilistic forecasts** to help retail traders:

1. Find mispriced markets
2. Discover winning traders
3. Copy profitable strategies

---

## 🔌 Synthdata Integration

### 1. Market Analysis

We query Synthdata's Polymarket endpoints to identify edge:

```python
# Hourly BTC Up/Down predictions
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.synthdata.co/insights/polymarket/up-down/hourly",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Apikey {API_KEY}"},
    params={"asset": "BTC"}
)

data = response.json()
synth_prob = data['synth_probability_up']
market_prob = data['polymarket_probability_up']
edge = synth_prob - market_prob

if abs(edge) > 0.05:  # 5% threshold
    # Flag market as mispriced
    create_alpha_signal(market_id, edge)
```

**Endpoints used:**
- `/insights/polymarket/up-down/hourly`
- `/insights/polymarket/up-down/daily`
- `/insights/volatility` (planned)

### 2. Conviction Scoring

We built a multi-signal scoring engine that combines:

- **Synthdata predictions** (40% weight)
- **Volume analysis** (30% weight)
- **Trader behavior** (30% weight)

**Output:** Conviction score (0-100) for each market

**Algorithm:**
```python
def calculate_conviction(market):
    # Synthdata signal
    synthdata_edge = abs(synth_prob - market_prob)
    synthdata_score = min(synthdata_edge * 10, 40)
    
    # Volume signal
    volume_score = analyze_volume(market)  # Max 30 pts
    
    # Trader sentiment
    trader_score = analyze_traders(market)  # Max 30 pts
    
    return synthdata_score + volume_score + trader_score
```

### 3. Trader Discovery

We analyze trader performance on **Synthdata-accurate markets**:

- Find traders who consistently align with Synthdata signals
- Calculate "Synthdata Alpha Correlation" score
- Rank traders by multi-dimensional metrics

**Use case:** Copy traders who have proven ability to spot what Synthdata spots.

### 4. AI-Powered Context

We enhance Synthdata predictions with **Perplexity API** for real-time market intelligence:

- **News analysis:** Fetch breaking news related to market questions
- **Sentiment scoring:** Analyze public sentiment on events
- **Context enrichment:** Add qualitative data to quantitative predictions

**Integration:**
```python
# Get market context from Perplexity
context = perplexity.query(
    f"What factors are affecting {market_question}?"
)

# Boost conviction based on sentiment
if positive_sentiment(context):
    conviction_score += sentiment_boost
```

**Why it matters:** Synthdata gives probabilities. Perplexity explains *why*.
