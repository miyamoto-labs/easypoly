        Tiers rank quality from S (Elite, top 1%) to D (Weak). Both picks and traders get tier badges. 
        <strong className="text-text-primary"> S-tier 🔥</strong> is the best, 
        <strong className="text-text-primary"> A-tier 💎</strong> is strong, 
        <strong className="text-text-primary"> B-tier ⚡</strong> is decent, 
        <strong className="text-text-primary"> C-tier 📊</strong> is marginal, and 
        <strong className="text-text-primary"> D-tier ⬇️</strong> is weak. Focus on S and A tiers for the highest-quality signals.

        Yes! EasyPoly is currently free during beta. You get full access to picks, PolyTinder, trader discovery, and portfolio tracking. 
        We may introduce premium features in the future, but the core experience will always have a free tier.

    question: "What are Wild Picks?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Wild Picks are high-risk, high-reward opportunities with asymmetric payoff profiles. They typically trade at very low prices (5¢-20¢) 
        with potential for 5-20x returns. Think of them like lottery tickets — fun, but don&apos;t bet the farm. 
        They&apos;re marked with a special 🃏 badge so you know what you&apos;re getting into.

    ),
  },
  {
    id: "faq-update-frequency",
    question: "How often are picks updated?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Picks are updated continuously as market conditions change. New picks are generated every few minutes. 
        The Daily Super Pick refreshes once per day at 00:00 UTC. Scores are recalculated in real-time as prices, 
        volume, and momentum shift.

    ),
  },
  {
    id: "faq-filter-category",
    question: "Can I filter by category?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes! Both the Picks page and Traders page support category filters. Choose from Politics 🏛️, Sports ⚽, 
        Crypto ₿, Culture 🎬, Finance 💹, or Wild 🃏. You can also combine filters with tier badges and 
        sort options for precise discovery.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "faq-super-pick",
    question: "What's a Daily Super Pick?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        The Daily Super Pick is our single highest-conviction opportunity each day. It&apos;s chosen by scoring 
        all active markets, filtering for minimum liquidity ($50k+) and edge (10%+), and selecting the top scorer. 
        It appears at the top of the Picks page with a gold border. Historical win rate: ~68%.
